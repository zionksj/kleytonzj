My name is Kleyton Marques, also known as "zy" (my codename in the virtual world). I'm a frontend developer constantly evolving since 2022. I'm deeply in love with my girlfriend, Lelly.

My first experience with code was back in the days of Forumotion communities. I clearly remember trying to find ways to change some elements and bring new things to life. I used to spend hours customizing my “site” without even noticing how quickly the day would fly by.
The thrill of being able to build pages with just your own effort is simply incredible. You start with the basics, nothing makes sense at first and then suddenly, boom, you have a finished project.
